@title[#:tag "pict3d"]{Pict3D: Functional 3D Scenes}

@author{@(author+email "Neil Toronto" (author-email))}

Pict3D is written in Typed Racket, but can be used in untyped Racket without significant performance
loss.

@defmodule[pict3d]

Pict3D provides a purely functional interface to rendering hardware, and is intended to be a
performant, modern 3D engine.
It's getting there.

Pict3D draws on @racketmodname[pict] for inspiration, though some aspects of working in three
dimensions make direct analogues impossible or very difficult.
For example,
@itemlist[
 @item{In a 3D scene, solid colors alone are insufficient to indicate the shapes of objects.}
 @item{Unlike 2D scenes, 3D scenes must be @emph{projected} onto two dimensions for display.
       The projection isn't unique, so displaying a 3D scene requires additional information.}
 @item{In 3D, it's possible to create combiners that stack scenes vertically and horizontally.
       Unfortunately, there would be nine for each axis, to line up corners, edges, and centers,
       for a total of 27.}
 ]

Pict3D's solutions to these difficulties take more or less standard forms: lights, cameras, and affine
transformations.
But what is @emph{not} standard is the overall design:
@itemlist[
 @item{Pict3D makes no distinction between development and production/deployment.
       All functions for developing scenes are available during runtime, and vice-versa.}
 @item{The procedures used to create and update scenes are purely functional.}
]
Scenes are thus fully persistent, which offers many advantages.
For example, when running @racketmodname[pict3d/universe] programs, the current scene can be dumped
to DrRacket's REPL for inspection at any time by pressing @tt{F12}, without affecting the running
program.

@margin-note*{If you get OpenGL errors when using @racketmodname[pict3d], try adding
@racket[(current-pict3d-legacy? #t)] to the top of your programs.}
To make a @racket[Pict3D] instance containing a single shape, first load the @racketmodname[pict3d]
module, then apply a shape constructor:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (eval:alts (require pict3d) (void))
                    (sphere origin 1/2)]
This sphere's center position is @racket[(pos 0 0 0)], or the @racket[origin], and it has radius
@racket[1/2].
The red, green and blue bars are @emph{not} part of the scene.
They're just extra arrows drawn from the origin along the @italic{x}, @italic{y} and @italic{z} axes.

When the mouse hovers over a displayed @racket[Pict3D] instance, it looks something like this:

@centered{@indicators-png}

If you're following along in DrRacket, click on it.
@margin-note*{You can also click and drag to look.
              ``Mouse look'' doesn't work on Mac OS because of reasons.}
Move the mouse to look around, and use these keys to navigate:
@itemlist[
 @item{@tt{W} and @tt{S} (or @tt{↑} and @tt{↓}): forwards and backwards}
 @item{@tt{A} and @tt{D} (or @tt{←} and @tt{→}): left and right}
 @item{@tt{R} and @tt{F} (or @tt{PgUp} and @tt{PgDn}): up and down}
]
If you're familiar with first-person 3D games, this should feel fairly natural.
Click the mouse button again to return control of the keyboard and mouse to DrRacket.

Flying around demonstrates why the axis arrows are necessary.
The sphere looks similar from every direction, so it's easy to get lost.
(If you do get lost, press @tt{Esc}.)

The numbers in the lower right are information about the position and orientation of the closest
surface point in space under the mouse cursor.
Right-clicking allows you to copy the information to the clipboard.

The @scale-png in the upper right shows the scale the @racket[Pict3D] is rendered at.
Clicking on the @tt{-} and @tt{+} parts decrease and increase the scale.

@margin-note*{The @grid-icon-on-png icon toggles a global grid.
              The @wireframe-icon-on-png icon toggles triangle wireframes, which are good for showing
              @tech{tessellations}.}
Clicking the @sunlight-icon-on-png icon toggles the displayed @racket[Pict3D]'s default lighting,
which is also @emph{not} part of the scene.
Clicking the @indicators-icon-on-png icon toggles the origin axes and other indicators.
With default lighting off and indicators off, the display looks respectively like

@centered{@sunlight-off-png @hspace[4] @indicators-off-png}

With both off, the displayed @racket[Pict3D] looks like this:

@centered{@sunlight-off-indicators-off-png}

The above is the only @emph{faithful} display, identical to what you get by converting the sphere
into a bitmap:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (pict3d->bitmap (sphere origin 1/2))]
Our @racket[Pict3D] clearly needs better lighting to communicate its shape.
We'll combine it with a point light source on the @italic{x = 0} plane:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (pict3d->bitmap
                     (combine (sphere origin 1/2)
                              (light (pos 0 1 1))))]
If you evaluate @racket[(combine (sphere origin 1/2) (light (pos 0 1 1)))] (i.e. without converting to
a bitmap) and fly around the scene, you'll find the point light represented by a glowing octahedron:

@centered{@light-indicator-png}

If you then click @indicators-icon-on-png, the octahedron will disappear, because it's not part of the
scene, either.
The light itself is actually invisible.

In general, a @racket[Pict3D] is comprised of the following kinds of objects.
@itemlist[
 @item{Shapes: visible 2D surfaces in 3D space. Surfaces are visible on only one side.}
 @item{Lights: invisible color emitters.}
 @item{Groups: invisible, named, oriented collections of other objects.}
]

Only one group is special: the one named @racket['camera].
When a @racket[Pict3D] is renderered, if a group named @racket['camera] exists, that group's
orientation is used as the viewpoint.
To look down on our sphere, we can combine it with a downward-oriented camera group:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (combine (sphere origin 1/2)
                             (basis 'camera (point-at (pos 0 0 2) origin)))]
The @racket[basis] function creates an empty group with a given orientation, while
@racket[(point-at (pos 0 0 2) origin)] creates an orientation looking at the @racket[origin] from the
point @racket[(pos 0 0 2)].

If a @racket['camera] group isn't in the scene, an orientation is chosen automatically by
@racket[(current-pict3d-auto-camera)].

The examples in this section are easiest to compare when using an auto camera that doesn't depend on
the @racket[Pict3D] instance.

A naive rendering algorithm would take time proportional to @italic{n·m}, where @italic{n} is the
number of objects in a scene and @italic{m} is the number of lights.
Pict3D uses @hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading"]{deferred lighting}
algorithms that take time proportional to @italic{n+m}.

Deferred lighting algorithms ``draw'' each light on every fragment of the rendered scene that
shows a surface the light might illuminate.
An ideal point light illuminates surfaces at any distance, so each ideal point light would have to be
drawn on the entire rendered scene.
@margin-note*{Even with these optimizations, lights tend to take more time to render than solid
              objects. Try to use only a few thousand well-spaced lights.}
Adding ideal point lights quickly becomes prohibitively expensive, so Pict3D restricts each
light's effect to a light-specific range @racket[r].

Instead of forcing a light's effect to zero at distance @racket[r], Pict3D forces smooth attenuation
to zero over a finite range. Forced attenuation starts at distance @racket[(/ r 2)] and follows a
quadratic curve. The quadratic curve's first derivative matches the ideal's curve's first derivative
at @racket[(/ r 2)], and is zero at @racket[r] (so the overall attenuation is
@hyperlink["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothness"]{C¹-continuous}),
which reduces visual artifacts.

@centered{@light-plot}

With the default value of @racket[r], forced attenuation starts when ideal attenuation is
4/40 = 0.1, and ends when ideal attenuation would be 1/40 = 0.025.
(See @racket[current-light-range].)
Thus, a single light's effect with the default @racket[r] tends to be hard to distinguish from an
ideal light's effect.
Much smaller values of @racket[r] can result in major discrepancies.

In fact, with @racket[#:range 1] in the above example, the light has no apparent effect at all.

Small ranges are useful when a light is used for a local visual effect (such as a magical shine
on a blade) or when many lights in one area slow down rendering too much.

Large ranges are useful when many weak lights illuminate a surface.
Try to choose the smallest large range that gives an effect similar to that of
@racket[#:range +inf.0].

Here, the light affects surfaces at distances only in the range [30·0.044,30·0.45] = [1.32,1.35].

Transforming a light may change its initially spherical area of effect to an ellipsoid.
This allows lights inside of solid objects to approximate light emission from the objects' surfaces.

@section[#:tag "vector"]{Position and Direction Vectors}

A vector in 3D space is uniquely identified by three real numbers called @deftech{coordinates} or
@deftech{components}.
For example, the coordinates of @racket[(pos 1 2 3)] are @racket[1], @racket[2] and @racket[3].

Pict3D distinguishes between two kinds of vectors:
@itemlist[
 @item{A @deftech{position vector}, which is a value of type @racket[Pos], represents an absolute
       position in 3D space.}
 @item{A @deftech{direction vector}, which is a value of type @racket[Dir], represents a direction,
       with distance, in 3D space.}
]
Generally, think of direction vectors as how to get from one position vector in space to another.

@interaction-eval[#:eval pict3d-eval
                         (current-pict3d-auto-camera
                          (λ (_) (point-at (pos 0.4 -0.5 1.15) (pos 0.4 1.0 0))))]

Suppose we define a direction vector @racket[dv1] as
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define dv1 (dir 1 1 0))]
To picture it, we need a starting position vector.
We'll arbitrarily choose the @racket[origin], which is @racket[(pos 0 0 0)].
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define v origin)
                    (arrow v dv1)]
We can use the direction vector @racket[dv1] to move the center of a sphere.
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define move-once
                      (combine (arrow v dv1)
                               (sphere v 0.1)
                               (sphere (pos+ v dv1) 0.1)))
                    (eval:alts move-once ((λ () move-once)))]
We might even define another direction vector @racket[dv2] (pointing upward) to move it again.
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define dv2 (dir 0 0 1))
                    (define move-twice
                      (combine move-once
                               (arrow (pos+ v dv1) dv2)
                               (sphere (pos+ (pos+ v dv1) dv2) 0.1)))
                    (eval:alts move-twice ((λ () move-twice)))]
But we don't have to move it twice: we can move it just once, by adding the direction vectors
@racket[dv1] and @racket[dv2].
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define dv (dir+ dv1 dv2))
                    (define move-twice-by-moving-once
                      (combine (arrow v dv)
                               (sphere v 0.1)
                               (sphere (pos+ v dv) 0.1)))
                    (combine move-twice-by-moving-once
                             (set-color move-twice (rgba "red" 0.75)))]
Composing transformations---not just movement, but all parallel-line-preserving transformations---is
discussed in the section @secref{affine}.

Directions are used to move entire scenes, not just points:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (move (combine (with-color (rgba "red" 0.5)
                                     (cube origin 1/3))
                                   (sphere origin 0.05))
                          (dir 1/2 1/2 0))]
When used as scaling factors, as in @racket[(rectangle origin (dir 1/3 1/3 1))], directions represent
moving the center to a corner:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (move (combine (with-color (rgba "red" 0.5)
                                     (rectangle origin (dir 1/3 1/3 1)))
                                   (sphere origin 0.05)
                                   (arrow origin (dir 1/3 1/3 1)))
                          (dir 1/2 1/2 0))]

@section[#:tag "combining-scenes"]{Combining Scenes}

In 3D space, the terms @emph{horizontal} and @emph{vertical} are ambiguous.

When there's no unique or preferred way to view an object, even the terms @emph{top}, @emph{bottom},
@emph{left}, @emph{right}, @emph{front} and @emph{back} are ambiguous.

When an object is squashed or rotated, or is irregularly shaped, these terms are ambiguous even with
a preferred orientation.
For example, if we say that the following ellipsoid is leaning to the right, there are at least two
acceptable ways to interpret the term @emph{on the left side}:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define p1 (rotate-y (ellipsoid origin (dir 1/4 1/4 1)) -30))
                    (define camera (basis 'camera (point-at (pos 1 1 4) (dir -1 -1 0))))
                    (combine (move-z p1 4)
                             (with-emitted (emitted "green")
                               (arrow (pos 0.75 0 4.25) (dir -0.45 0 -0.25)))
                             (with-emitted (emitted "red")
                               (arrow (pos 1.05 0 3.25) (dir -0.5 0 0)))
                             camera)]
Now suppose we decide that the green arrow points at the ``left side,'' and that we want to attach the
face of a cube to it.
There are infinitely many ways to do so: one for each point on the face and each angle of rotation.

In general, combining two 3D scenes relationally requires specifying a lot of data.

Pict3D tries to reduce the burden by
@itemlist[
 @item{Allowing @racket[Pict3D] instances to be combined by naming groups in each instance to attach
       together.}
 @item{Making it easy to add such groups at specific points with specific orientations.}
]

For example, the following code defines a @deftech{basis}, which is an empty group, on the left side
of the ellipsoid @racket[p1], pointing away from the surface.
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define-values (v dv) (surface/normal p1 +x))
                    (define left (basis 'left (point-at v dv)))]
Here, the @racket[surface/normal] function finds a point on the surface of @racket[p1] in the
direction @racket[+x].
It returns that point and a @deftech{surface normal}, which is the direction perpendicular to the
surface at that point.
The @racket[point-at] function returns an @tech{affine transformation} that represents pointing in the
direction @racket[dv] from position @racket[v].
Finally, @racket[basis] creates a @racket[Pict3D] out of the result.

We could display @racket[left], but it's more instructive to combine it with the ellipsoid whose
surface it's on.
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define p1/left (move-z (combine p1 left) 4))
                    (combine p1/left camera)]
(We've moved it upward @racket[4] units only to keep the origin's axes from obscuring the new basis.)
Notice that the blue arrow points outward.

Now we'll create a cube to attach onto that basis.
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define p2 (with-color (rgba "deepskyblue" 0.75)
                                 (cube origin 1/4)))
                    (define top (basis 'top (point-at (surface p2 +z) -z)))
                    (define p2/top (move-z (combine p2 top) 4))
                    (eval:alts p2/top ((λ () p2/top)))]
(Again, we've moved it upward, away from the origin's axes.)
This time, we used @racket[surface] instead of @racket[surface/normal] because we know the surface
normal: @racket[+z].
But we haven't applied @racket[point-at] to @racket[+z], we've used @racket[-z] instead, causing the
blue arrow to point in the direction opposite the surface normal: downward, into the cube.

All we have left is to @racket[pin] the scenes together:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define p3 (pin p1/left '(left)
                                    p2/top '(top)))
                    (combine p3 camera)]
@margin-note*{Because @racket[(pin pict1 path1 pict2 path2)] puts @racket[pict2] @emph{inside} of the
              group @racket[path1], it naturally creates group hierarchies. When this isn't what you
              want, use @racket[join] instead.}
This has applied the transformation necessary to make the basis named @racket['top] in @racket[p2/top]
match the basis named @racket['left] in @racket[p1/left], and combined the transformed @racket[p2/top]
with @racket[p1/left].
In other words, it's rotated and moved @racket[p2/top] so that @racket[top]'s red arrow is the same as
@racket[left]'s red arrow, @racket[top]'s green arrow is the same as @racket[left]'s green arrow, and
@racket[top]'s blue arrow is the same as @racket[left]'s blue arrow.

(We refer to the group named @racket['left] using the @tech{tag path} @racket['(left)].)

Suppose we want to rotate the cube @racket[30] degrees.
We have a few options.
@itemlist[
 @item{Recreate @racket[p1/left] with a rotated @racket[left] basis, and then recreate @racket[p3].}
 @item{Recreate @racket[p2/top] with a rotated @racket[top] basis, and then recreate @racket[p3].}
 @item{Replace the group named @racket['left] in @racket[p3] with the same group rotated @racket[30]
       degrees.}
]
The first option only requires us to replace @racket[(basis 'left (point-at v dv))] in the definition
of @racket[left] with @racket[(basis 'left (point-at v dv #:angle 30))].
The second option requires similar changes to @racket[top].
But at this point, with @racket[p3] already defined, both are more work than the third option, which
is simply this:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (combine (replace-group p3 '(left) (λ (p) (rotate-z p 30)))
                             camera)]
This replaces, in @racket[p3], every group @racket[p] named @racket['left] with
@racket[(rotate-z p 30)].
The cube rotates because the group named @racket['left] in @racket[p3] isn't empty any longer: it's
been filled with a transformed @racket[p2/top].

It's instructive to consider what would have happened if we'd had @racket[p2/top]'s basis point in the
direction of the surface normal; i.e. if we had used @racket[+z] instead of @racket[-z].
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (define top (basis 'top (point-at (surface p2 +z) +z)))
                    (define p2/top (move-z (combine p2 top) 4))
                    (eval:alts p2/top ((λ () p2/top)))
                    (combine (pin p1/left '(left)
                                  p2/top '(top))
                             camera)]
Generally, when we want to pin two @racket[Pict3D] instances together using bases, one's basis should
point inward, and the other's should point outward.

The type and predicate for names of groups.
Currently, @racket[Tag] is defined as @racket[(U Symbol Integer)].

Functions that operate on groups do not accept a @racket[Tag] value on its own.
They accept a @deftech{tag path}, which is a @emph{list} of @racket[Tag] values.
This allows them to operate on groups within groups.
For example, to remove the contents of the group named @racket['cannon] within a group named
@racket['player], we might write
@racketblock[(remove-in-group world '(player cannon))]
Then, only the poor player will be left without a printer.

To remove the contents of @emph{every} cannon group regardless of the group that contains it, we
might write
@racketblock[(remove-in-group world '(cannon))]

The tag path @racket['()] or @racket[empty] refers to an entire @racket[Pict3D].
Thus,
@racketblock[(remove-in-group world '())]

If @racket[path1] or @racket[path2] is given as an @tech{affine transformation}, @racket[join]
uses them directly instead of looking up a group transformation.

If there is more than one group with @racket[path1] in @racket[pict1], @racket[join] raises an error,
and likewise for @racket[path2] in @racket[pict2].

Recall that the @tech{tag path} @racket['()] represents the entire @racket[Pict3D].
Thus, when @racket[path2] is @racket['()] or is omitted, the origin and coordinate axes are used for
alignment.

An inconsistent transformation turns clockwise-oriented shapes or directions counterclockwise, and
vice-versa.

Some 3D engines are sensitive to consistency: they will render shapes inside-out or turn normals the
wrong direction when inconsistent transformations are applied.
Pict3D's rendering engine is not sensitive to consistency.

@defproc[(freeze [pict Pict3D]) Pict3D]{
Returns a @racket[Pict3D] with identical shapes and lights, which, when first rendered, is optimized
for streaming to the graphics card.
Nonempty groups are @racket[ungroup]ed.
Empty groups are retained.

The optimization takes more time than rendering the original @racket[pict], so use @racket[freeze] to
optimize unchanging, frequently drawn sub-scenes.
For static scenes with tens of thousands of shapes, order-of-magnitude speedups are typical.

The results of transformations, and of combiners such as @racket[combine] and @racket[pin], which do
not alter shapes or their attributes, retain the optimized streaming data.
The results of attribute-altering functions such as @racket[set-color] do not.
}

@subsection[#:tag "parameters"]{Rendering Parameters}

The parameters in this section are read when a @racket[Pict3D] is @emph{displayed}, not when it's
@emph{created}.
In other words, don't expect this to result in a 512x512 display:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (parameterize ([current-pict3d-width 512]
                                   [current-pict3d-height 512])
                      (sphere origin 1/2))]
By the time the sphere is displayed, the parameters have returned to their original values.

This is correct behavior.
A @racket[Pict3D] represents the contents of 3D space, which has nothing to do with how those
contents are viewed.

For the parameters to have an effect on interactive displays, they should be mutated:
@interaction[#:eval pict3d-eval
                    (current-pict3d-width 512)
                    (current-pict3d-height 512)

@deftypedparam[current-pict3d-legacy? legacy? Boolean Boolean (#:value #f)]{
Determines the value sent to the @method[gl-config% set-legacy?] method of @racket[gl-config%] when
creating an OpenGL rendering context.

In general, you should only try setting @racket[(current-pict3d-legacy? #t)] if you're getting
strange OpenGL errors.

On Mac OS, this parameter @emph{must} be @racket[#f].
If @racket[#t], only OpenGL 2.1 is available.
If @racket[#f], OpenGL 3.2 or higher is available.
Pict3D requires at least OpenGL 3.0.

On Linux, this parameter may be (or may have to be) either @racket[#t] or @racket[#f], depending on
the graphics driver.

On Windows, this parameter is currently ignored.
}

@deftypedparam[current-pict3d-check-version? check-version? Boolean Boolean (#:value #t)]{
Determines whether Pict3D checks the OpenGL version.

When @racket[current-pict3d-check-version?] is @racket[#t], Pict3D raises an error when the OpenGL
version is less than 3.0.
Otherwise, it doesn't check, and counts on hardware and drivers implementing equivalent extensions.

@bold{Use this at your own risk.}
Pict3D will work on standards-compliant implementations of OpenGL 3.0 or higher, but there is
no such guarantee for lower versions, even when they implement all the required extensions.
Further, if Pict3D works on a lower version, don't expect it to keep doing so.
In the future, Pict3D might use a 3.0 feature that your hardware or driver doesn't implement an
extension for.
If Pict3D doesn't work when @racket[current-pict3d-check-version?] is @racket[#f], it may raise
errors, render garbage, or cause segfaults.

Currently, @hyperlink["http://www.mesa3d.org/"]{Mesa 3D}'s software rendering implements all the
required extensions.
On Linux, if your graphics driver uses Mesa's infrastructure, you can use its software renderer by
starting DrRacket with

@tt{     LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=TRUE <racket-binary-path>/drracket}

and putting @racket[(current-pict3d-check-version? #f)] at the top of your programs.

@defmodule[pict3d/universe]

@(define-runtime-path dun-dun-dun.mp3 "sounds/215558__divenorth__dun-dun-duuun-v-01.mp3")

This module provides functionality for creating interactive, graphical programs in the style of
@racketmodname[2htdp/universe]; i.e. by defining plain mathematical functions.
The biggest difference is that scenes are in THE THIRD DIMENSION!
@;{@hyperlink[dun-dun-dun.mp3]{THE THIRD DIMENSION}.}

Another difference is that @racket[big-bang3d], the analogue of @racket[big-bang] in
@racketmodname[2htdp/universe], is a plain Racket function with keyword arguments.

Besides minor stylistic differences, there are some significant interface differences.
Callback functions receive not only the current state, but a frame count and an inexact number of
milliseconds since the big bang.
There is no separate pad handler, no separate draw handler for the initial and final states, and no
separate frame limit.
On the whole, the interface is both a little more streamlined and a little more complicated.

What did you expect? You're doing 3D. You're playing with the big kids now.

One of the simplest @racketmodname[pict3d/universe] programs is
@racketmod[racket
(require pict3d
         pict3d/universe)
(big-bang3d 0)]

This opens a 512x512 window named @tt{World3D} that renders @racket[empty-pict3d] at 30 frames per
second, which responds to no events except those that close the window.
When the window closes, @racket[big-bang3d] returns @racket[0], which was given as the initial state.

A slightly more complicated program does the ol' spinning cube animation:
@racketmod[racket

           (require pict3d
                    pict3d/universe)
           
           (current-material (material #:ambient 0.01

                                       #:roughness 0.2))
           
           (define lights+camera
             (combine (light (pos 0 1 2) (emitted "Thistle"))
                      (light (pos 0 -1 -2) (emitted "PowderBlue"))
                      (basis 'camera (point-at (pos 1 1 0) origin))))
           
           (define (on-draw s n t)
             (combine (rotate-z (rotate-y (rotate-x (cube origin 1/2)
                                                    (/ t 11))
                                          (/ t 13))
                                (/ t 17))
                      lights+camera))

Runs a ``3D world'' program.

On startup, @racket[big-bang3d] begins to keep track of
@itemlist[
 @item{The current state @racket[s : S], initially set to @racket[init-state].}
 @item{The frame number @racket[n : Natural], initially set to @racket[0].}
 @item{The time @racket[t : Flonum], in milliseconds, initially set to @racket[0.0].}
]
All callback functions---@racket[valid-state?], @racket[pause-state?], @racket[stop-state?], @racket[on-frame],
@racket[on-key], @racket[on-release], @racket[on-mouse] and @racket[on-draw]---receive the current
values of @racket[s], @racket[n] and @racket[t].

There are two phases in running a 3D world program: initialization and frame loop.
In the initialization phase, @racket[big-bang3d] does the following once.
@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
 @item{Computes @racket[(valid-state? s n t)]; if @racket[#f], raises an error.}
 @item{Computes @racket[(pause-state? s n t)].}
 @item{Computes @racket[(stop-state? s n t)].}
 @item{Creates a window with title @racket[name] and a @racket[width]-by-@racket[height] client
       area. The window contains only a @racket[pict3d-canvas%] with @racket[(on-draw s n t)] as
       its initial @racket[Pict3D]. The window is positioned at @racket[x] and @racket[y]
       on the screen (where @racket[#f] values use auto-placement). The @racket[display-mode]
       determines the window's style, either as a normal window, a fullscreen window, or
       a fullscreen-like window that hides the window's title and menu bar (but is not ``fullscreen''
       from the platform's perspective). The canvas is configured with @racket[gl-config],
       and @racket[cursor] is installed as the canvas's cursor.}
 @item{Waits one second for the GUI machinery to start up.}
 @item{Synchronizes on a signal that the window has painted itself for the first time.}
]
If @racket[(stop-state? s n t)] returned @racket[#f], @racket[big-bang3d] enters the frame loop phase.
In the frame loop phase, @racket[big-bang3d] repeats the following.
@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
 @item{Updates @racket[n] to @racket[(+ n 1)].}
 @item{Updates @racket[t] to the numer of milliseconds since @racket[big-bang3d] was called
       minus the number of milliseconds spent in paused states.}
 @item{Computes @racket[(on-frame s n t)] to yield a new state @racket[s].}
 @item{Handles all accumulated keyboard and mouse events, which also update @racket[s]---and
       waits until a new keyboard or mouse event if the most recent @racket[s] is a pause state.}
 @item{Computes @racket[(on-draw s n t)] to yield a new @racket[Pict3D], which it sets in the canvas.}
 @item{Computes the number of milliseconds @racket[ms] until @racket[frame-delay] milliseconds will
       have passed since the start of the frame, and sleeps for @racket[(max 1.0 ms)] milliseconds.}
]
Sleeping for at least one millisecond gives the canvas time to receive GUI events when a frame
loop iteration takes longer than @racket[frame-delay] milliseconds.

Key presses are handled by computing @racket[(on-key s n t k)] to yield a new state @racket[s].
Key releases are handled by computing @racket[(on-release s n t k)] to yield a new state @racket[s].
In both cases, the key event code @racket[k] is the value returned by @method[key-event% get-key-code]
or @method[key-event% get-key-release-code], converted to a string.

Mouse events are handled by computing @racket[(on-mouse s n t x y e)] to yield a new state @racket[s].
The values @racket[x] and @racket[y] are the mouse cursor's event position, and @racket[e] is a string
that indicates what kind of event occurred.
Values for @racket[e] are the symbols returned by the method @method[mouse-event% get-event-type]
of @racket[mouse-event%], converted to strings, unless the symbol is @racket['motion].
In that case, @racket[e] is @racket["drag"] if a mouse button is pressed; otherwise @racket["move"].

After every state update, the frame loop
@itemlist[#:style 'ordered
 @item{Checks @racket[(valid-state? s n t)]; if @racket[#f], raises an error.}
 @item{Checks @racket[(pause-state? s n t)] to determine whether to pause the frame.}
 @item{Checks @racket[(stop-state? s n t)]; if @racket[#t], flags the frame loop as being on its last
       iteration.}
]
If @racket[stop-state?] ever returns @racket[#t] or the window is closed, the frame loop exits after
completing its current iteration, and @racket[big-bang3d] returns @racket[s].

The callbacks @racket[valid-state?], @racket[stop-state?] and @racket[on-draw] can determine whether
they're being used during the initialization phase by checking @racket[(zero? n)].
